# Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

###  Why
- **Simplicity** It simplifies the client interface and improves usability.
- **Decoupling** It decouples a client from a complex subsystem, promoting loose coupling.
- **Improved organization** It provides a high-level layer that makes the subsystem easier to use and understand.

### Applicability
- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
